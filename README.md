# HGV_stock_model
This HGV_stock_model describes the turnover of the Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) sector in Ireland for the period 2021-2030. The model was developed by Dr Shane McDonogh as part of the research project, "Mitigation measures to reduce CO2 emissions from the existing Irish heavy goods vehicle fleet". The project was supported with funding from Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). For the period 2021-2030 the model presents an analysis of the potential CO2 emissions reduction from eco-driving, biofuel blending, higher fleet turnover and CNG penetration.
